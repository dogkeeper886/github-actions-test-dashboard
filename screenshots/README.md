## Screenshot Guidelines

- **Resolution**: Use viewport screenshots (not full page)
- **No Private Information**: Avoid showing sensitive data
  - Repository names are okay (it's a public dashboard)
  - User "dogkeeper886" is okay (it's visible in commits)
  - Commit SHAs are okay
- **Clean Display**: 
  - No browser chrome (just the dashboard content)
  - Logs should have ANSI codes stripped (this is already implemented)
- **File Format**: PNG format
- **Naming**: Use exact names listed above with numeric prefixes for ordering

## How to Take Screenshots

1. Navigate to http://192.168.2.103 (or your dashboard URL)
2. Use a screenshot tool (scrot, flameshot, etc.)
3. Follow the content requirements above for each screenshot
4. Save with the exact filename in this directory
5. Verify all 4 screenshots are present before committing
