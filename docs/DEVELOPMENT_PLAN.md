## Phase Breakdown

### **Phase 0: Foundation (P0)**
**Goal:** Get basic infrastructure running and data flowing
- Set up project structure (backend/frontend/docker)
- Create database schema for workflows, runs, tests
- Implement GitHub API client
- Build data collector that polls GitHub and stores results
- **Success Criteria:** Data is being collected and stored

### **Phase 1: Core MVP (P1)** 
**Goal:** Basic dashboard functionality
- Display workflows and their runs
- Show test results with basic formatting
- View individual test logs
- **Success Criteria:** Users can see their test results in the dashboard

### **Phase 2: Essential UX (P2)**
**Goal:** Key differentiators that solve the main pain points
- Failed tests shown first (critical UX improvement)
- Screenshots displayed inline (no downloads needed)
- Basic search to find specific tests
- **Success Criteria:** Debugging time reduced significantly vs GitHub UI

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Features (P3)**
**Goal:** Polish and usability improvements
- Better log formatting and highlighting
- Historical test data and trends
- Filtering capabilities
- Mobile-friendly design
- **Success Criteria:** Professional, polished user experience

### **Phase 4+: Analytics & Polish (P4-P5)**
**Goal:** Advanced features and nice-to-haves
- Test analytics and trend analysis
- Advanced search and filtering
- UI polish and additional features

## Key Dependencies & Risks

**High Risk Items:**
- GitHub API rate limits and artifact handling
- Screenshot extraction from artifacts
- Database performance with large test datasets
- Flaky test detection algorithm

**Critical Path:**
Foundation → Core MVP → Essential UX (this gets you to a usable product)

## Effort Legend
- **Low:** 1-3 days
- **Medium:** 4-7 days  
- **High:** 1-2+ weeks

## Priority Legend
- **P0:** Must have for basic functionality
- **P1:** Core features for MVP
- **P2:** Essential UX improvements
- **P3:** Enhanced features for polish
- **P4:** Analytics and advanced features
- **P5:** Nice-to-have polish items
