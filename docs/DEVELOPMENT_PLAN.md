## Phase Breakdown

### **Phase 0: Foundation (P0)** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Goal:** Get basic infrastructure running and data flowing
- ‚úÖ Set up project structure (backend/docker) 
- ‚úÖ Create PostgreSQL database schema for workflows, runs, files
- ‚úÖ Implement GitHub API client with Octokit
- ‚úÖ Build artifact download and file extraction system
- üîÑ Build data collector that polls GitHub and stores results (IN PROGRESS)
- **Success Criteria:** ‚úÖ Data is being collected and stored

**Current Status:** Infrastructure complete, database operational, API working. Ready for enhanced data collection.

### **Phase 1: Core MVP (P1)** üîÑ **CURRENT PHASE**
**Goal:** Enhanced data collection and basic dashboard functionality
- üîÑ Implement periodic data collection (every 5 minutes)
- üîÑ Store workflow runs and extracted files in database
- üîÑ Build manual refresh capability
- ‚è≥ Display workflows and their runs (frontend needed)
- ‚è≥ Show file results with categorization (frontend needed)
- ‚è≥ View individual file content (frontend needed)
- **Success Criteria:** Users can see their workflow results in the dashboard

**Next Steps:** Complete data collection service, then build frontend components.

### **Phase 2: Essential UX (P2)**
**Goal:** Key differentiators that solve the main pain points
- Failed tests shown first (critical UX improvement)
- Screenshots displayed inline (no downloads needed)
- Basic search to find specific tests
- **Success Criteria:** Debugging time reduced significantly vs GitHub UI

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Features (P3)**
**Goal:** Polish and usability improvements
- Better log formatting and highlighting
- Historical test data and trends
- Filtering capabilities
- Mobile-friendly design
- **Success Criteria:** Professional, polished user experience

### **Phase 4+: Analytics & Polish (P4-P5)**
**Goal:** Advanced features and nice-to-haves
- Test analytics and trend analysis
- Advanced search and filtering
- UI polish and additional features
